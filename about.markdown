Nancy’s cutting skills, artistic vision and impeccable attention to detail is what keeps her clients loyal; they know they can count on her working diligently to come up with styles individualized to their desires.

Nancy is happily married & has four very busy and active boys she credits her ability to multi-task to them! She enjoys spending her free time (wait....what free time?!!) hanging out with the five men in her life. Being a Studio Owner, Hair Restoration Stylist, mom & wife can be a challenge but it is a challenge she happily takes on!
