# FAQ

## Regarding Hair Loss &amp; Hair Restoration

Do the hair systems stay on without coming off?
Yes, with great advancements in technology hair systems can be applied as contact lenses utilizing a special medical grade adhesive that secures the hair system in place for weeks at a time.

### Are hair systems painful or uncomfortable to wear?

Not at all in fact when hair systems are applied correctly clients actually forget they have it on until they receive compliments on how much younger they look, that’s when they remember!

### Can you shower and play sports while wearing a hair system?

Yes! Most of our clients are very active and wouldn't go without their hair replacement systemsor sports.

### Can hair systems be color matched to the client’s hair?

Yes. Human hair systems can be matched 100%. Customized solutions are available to create a very natural look.

### Wearing a hair system seems scary because usually you see bad hair pieces...how do you explain that?

Like in all industries you have business owners committed to bringing their clients the very best in technology, quality and product and then you have those that don’t invest in their staffs education or products and so the result is bad hair pieces. The unfortunate thing for us is that you cannot see the amazing work delivered but we take pride in the change it makes in our client’s lives.

### What really causes hair loss?

Dating as far back as history will take us; baldness has been a part of the aging process that many men fear the most. Before Rogaine™ or other topical solutions, hair transplants and hair additions, men coped in various ways from magic ointments to the styling of their hair. Julius Caesar grew his hair long in the back and combed it all forward. Napoleon did the same thing. Somehow we often disregard history and the fact that this has been an age-old condition. We can't imagine or accept the fact that there is not a cure.

Understanding the cause of male pattern hair loss may better indicate exactly why it presently has no cure.

Androgenetic Alopecia - the modem medical term for either male or female pattern hair loss can be broken down in two parts.

First, Androgenetic, consisting of androgen (Any of the various hormones that control the appearance and development of masculine characteristics such as testosterone).Then GENETIC—the inheritance of genes from either the mother or the father's side of the family. Add AGE, which when coupled with genetics, represents a time clock that will signal the hair follicle to produce an enzyme named 5 alpha reductase. When the testosterone present in the follicle combines with the enzyme 5 alpha reductase, it produces dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Hair follicle receptors are sensitive to DHT and thereby start the process of male or female pattern hair loss.

Second, alopecia meaning hair loss, of which there are many types.

Put simply, scientists are working against aging, hormones and genetics. This is no easy task. Add the fact that male or female pattern hair loss is not life threatening, it is easy to see why many physicians do not view hair loss as a priority in scientific research.

What is working for you in terms of research is that large pharmaceutical firms now know that a cure for hair loss could mean a fortune in revenue for their companies and stockholders. This is fuel enough and the race HAS begun.

Although we may not see a cure in our lifetime, it is possible. Science is closer to understanding hair loss due to the much recent advancement. To say the cure is around the corner would only be speculation but hope certainly is alive.

Until then...

Since there are other causes of hair loss, it is advisable to consult with a dermatologist who is competent and experienced with diagnosing hair loss. Confirming the type of hair loss you have will make it possible for you to know which treatment options may be best for you.

Other Causes of Hair Loss

- Alopecia areata: Generally thought to be an autoimmune disorder. Causes "patchy" hair loss, often in small circular areas in different areas of the scalp.
- Alopecia totalis: Total hair loss of the scalp, (an advanced form of alopecia areata).
- Alopecia universalis: Hair loss of the entire body, (also an advanced form of alopecia areata).
  Traction alopecia: Hair loss caused by physical stress and tension on the hair such as prolonged use of hair weaving, cornrows etc. Done too tightly on weak hair, these can cause permanent hair loss.
- Telogen effluvium: (usually temporary hair loss) Caused by physical stress, emotional stress, thyroid abnormalities, medications and hormonal causes normally associated with females.
- Anagen effluvium: Generally due to internally administered medications, such as chemotherapy agents that poisons the growing hair follicle.

All of these represent only a few of the different types of hair loss. Androgenetic alopecia represents close to 95% of all hair loss however.

#### Treatment Options Available for Male Pattern Hair Loss

- Hair Replacement Systems have made many advances in both appearance and more secure attachment methods.
- Hair Replacement Surgery has also made many advances towards more natural appearing results.

#### Female Pattern Hair Loss (Androgenetic Alopecia)

The most common type of hair loss seen in women is androgenetic alopecia, also known as female pattern alopecia or baldness. This is seen as hair thinning predominantly over the top and sides of the head. It affects approximately one-third of all susceptible women but is most commonly seen after menopause, although it may begin as early as puberty. Normal hair loss is approximately 100-125 hairs per day. Fortunately, these hairs are replaced. True hair loss occurs when lost hairs are not regrown or when the daily hair shed exceeds 125 hairs. Genetically, hair loss can come from either parent's side of the family.

There are two different types of hair loss, medically known as anagen effluvium and Telogen effluvium. Anagen effluvium is generally due to internally administered medications, such as chemotherapy agents, that poison the growing hair follicle. Telogen effluvium is due to an increased number of hair follicles entering the resting stage.

The most common causes of telogeneffluvium are:

- Physical stress: surgery, illness, anemia, and rapid weight change.
- Emotional stress: mental illness, death of a family member.
- Thyroidabnormalities
- Medications: High doses of Vitamin A, blood pressure and gout medications.
- Hormonal causes: pregnancy, birth control pills, and menopause.
- When the above causes of telogen effluvium are reversed or altered you should see the return of normal hair growth.

#### Diet Considerations

Hair loss may also occur due to dieting. Franchised diet programs that are designed or administered under the direction of a physician with prescribed meals, dietary supplements and vitamin ingestion have become popular. Sometimes the client is told that vitamins are a necessary part of the program to prevent hair loss associated with dieting. From a dermatologist's standpoint however, the vitamins cannot prevent hair loss associated with rapid, significant weight loss. Furthermore many of these supplements are high in vitamin A that can magnify the hair loss.

Physical and Emotional Stress

Surgeries, severe illnesses, and emotional stress can cause hair loss. The body simply shuts down production of hair during periods of stress since it is not necessary for survival and instead devotes its energies toward repairing vital body structures. In many cases there is a three-month delay between the actual event and the onset of hair loss. Furthermore, there may be another three-month delay prior to the return of noticeable hair regrowth. This then means that the total hair loss and regrowth cycle can last 6 months or possibly longer when induced by physical or emotional stress. There are some health conditions which may go undetected that can contribute to hair loss. These include anemia or low blood count and thyroid abnormalities. Both of these conditions can be detected by a simple, inexpensive blood test.

Hormonal Considerations

Hormonal changes are a common cause of female hair loss. Many women do not realize that hair loss can occur after pregnancy or following discontinuation of birth control pills. It is important to remember that the hair loss may be delayed by three months following the hormonal change and another three months will be required for new growth to be fully achieved.
