## Introducing Natural Advantage for Women

The totally undetectable, proven non-surgical hair replacement technology for women experiencing the devastating effects of female hair loss.

**Natural Advantage** is a non-surgical hair loss replacement technology that virtually becomes a part of you. The systems are designed specifically for women looking for a practical & fashionable solution to hair loss. Not a wig or hair piece, **Natural Advantage** offers a more permanent & comfortable solution to female hair loss without surgery.

## Any Color, Any Style. A Beautiful You.

Unlike chemicals or surgery, **Natural Advantage** guarantees a significant increase in hair density. **Natural Advantage** is not a surgical procedure; however, because it is unlike conventional hair replacement processes, only those certified by **Natural Advantage Experts** are allowed to deliver the process.

**Natural Advantage** employs a revolutionary hair replacement system that is designed to be thin, flexible, with a second skin-like surface that has natural hair growth patterns. The base being so thin and natural, it adheres with no ridges or bumps. It is literally undetectable to the human touch.

## What Type of Hair Loss do I have?

The degree & pattern of baldness can vary greatly, but the most common cause is male and female pattern baldness, also known as androgenic alopecia. Female Pattern balding (androgenic alopecia) should not be confused with alopecia areata, which commonly involves patchy hair loss. Extreme forms of alopecia areata are alopecia totalis, which involves the loss of all head hair, and the most extreme form, alopecia universalis, which involves the loss of all hair from the head and the body.
