## Say goodbye to hair loss anxiety 

Low-level laser hair therapy is a revolutionary, non-invasive breakthrough for men and women suffering the devastating effects of hair loss. With low-level laser hair therapy, you can achieve thicker, fuller, shinier, and healthier looking hair. The low-level lasers are “soft” lasers often referred to as “cold” lasers, and do not have the thermal-component to cut, burn or vaporize. Low-level laser therapy treatments utilize a device containing 30 therapeutic soft low-level light lasers which delivers light energy directly to the scalp. LLLT was developed in Europe for improving hair volume & improving hair shaft quality and prolonging the life of hair color and perms.

This breakthrough technology has recently been featured on national newscasts across the country. Physicians are praising this technology as an effective way to improve the hair quality and volume.

Nutritional supplements that promote healthy hair and Minoxidil-based topical treatments that help men and women in the early stages of hereditary hair loss.

## The benfits of low-level laser treatment:

- Increases the blood supply to the scalp by 54% after only one treatment.
- Stimulates hair follicles.
- Stops the progression of hair loss in 85% of patients.
- Increased hair strength and elasticity.
- Fuller, shinier, softer, thicker hair.
- Repairs damage normally caused by chemical services.
- Delivers light energy directly from different positions without loss of light properties to insure appropriate dosage.

## Proven technology

Low-level laser light has been used for numerous conditions in Europe for over thirty years and has been the subject of over 2,500 scientific papers, published worldwide. There are no reported side effects to the treatment which is painless, and non-toxic. Until recently, laser treatment has been relatively underutilized in North America. Today, however, there is increasing awareness and acceptance of low-level laser among practitioners.

International practitioners are realizing the benefits of laser therapy more than ever before, while North American consumers are increasingly willing to try alternative treatments. Low-level laser therapy is non-invasive and without any known side effects.

## What is low-level laser light?

Low-level laser light is compressed light of a wavelength from the cold, red part of the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation. It is different from natural light in that it is one precise color; it is coherent (it travels in a straight line), monochromatic (a single wavelength) and precisely focused (it concentrates its beam in a defined location or spot). These properties allow laser light to penetrate with no heating effect, no damage and no known side effects.

## High-power vs. low-level laser

There are two types of lasers: high-power and low-power. High power lasers are used to cut through tissue and give off heat. Low-level laser on the other hand does not give off heat and uses photo energy. For many years, leading hair restoration clinics and salons around the world have been using Transform Technologies ‘cold-beam’ laser technology for individuals suffering from problem hair conditions. It is a low-level laser therapy (LLLT) that works by increasing blood flow to the scalp and hair follicles, encouraging hair volume and healthier hair. The unique laser light penetrates into the scalp tissue where it stimulates the microcirculation and improves cellular metabolism and protein synthesis.

## Who is the best candidate for laser hair therapy?

For anyone experiencing hair loss, low-level laser hair therapy is the long anticipated answer for the hair transplant specialist challenged by the ineligibility to perform transplant procedures on certain individuals primarily due to the following scenarios:

Patients with early stages of hair loss 1 to 7 years (too much growing existing hair on the top of the head so that the option to transplant hair from the back of the head or “donor area” would cause “hair shock” or “hair trauma” to existing growing hair, thus accelerating loss of existing hairs.)

## Is it safe?

Absolutely! Low-level laser hair therapy meets all international safety standards and legislative specifications of a “non-significant risk” product. .Yes! The Laser Hair Therapy™ device is safe and is classified as a Class IIIA cosmetic laser.

The energy produced by the photons does not have the thermal component to cause thermal injuries to users or operators. Laser light energy does not change or alter molecular structures. There have been no side effects of the treatment reported and to give you an idea to what extent our treatment method has been used, an average example is from treatment centers in Finland where specialist have been offering the laser hair treatments for 11 years and during that period performed over 20.000 laser procedures, each without any side effects.

## How soon will I see results?

Reduction of hair loss usually occurs after five to six treatments. Some patients also experienced hair growth after 10-12 treatments. Over time, all users - men and women - usually notice progressively increasing benefits of the treatment program.
